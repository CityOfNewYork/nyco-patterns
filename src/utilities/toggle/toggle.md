The Toggle Utility is a simple JavaScript ES module that will show and hide and hide an element and its contents visibly and virtually from screen readers. The utility can be used with `<button>` elements, `<a>` tags, and supports a few additional common `aria` attributes for screen reader support. It is made available through the [Patterns Scripts library](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/patterns-scripts) included as a dependency of the {{ this.package.nice }}. [View the documentation](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/patterns-scripts/tree/main/src/toggle) for importing the ES module into project scripts and additional usage details.
