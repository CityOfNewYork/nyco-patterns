## Tailwind UI

*Tailwind UI* is a secondary product from the creators of Tailwindcss. It includes some examples of [complete components](https://tailwindui.com/components) built using the **default** Tailwindcss utility library. For the most part these examples could be built using the NYCO Patterns Tailwindcss implementation. There will be some differences in colors, drop shadows, type, dimensions, etc.

Below are a examples of Tailwind UI components built using the NYCO Patterns.
