The Modal Object is an accessible modal dialog created using [Tailwindcss](tailwindcss) utilities. It is based on the [*Simple grey Modal with footer* example from Tailwindui](https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/overlays/modals#component-47a5888a08838ad98779d50878d359b3). This example uses the Dialog Utility to achieve the showing and hiding effect. The main dialog element will be hidden from screen readers using the `aria-hidden` attribute and potentially focusable children will have their tabindex set to `-1` when the modal is hidden. When the modal is open, focus will shift to the `"close"` element and focus will cycle through elements within the dialog. Additionally, scrolling on the body element will be blocked until the dialog is dismissed.
