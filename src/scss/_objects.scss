/**
 * Objects
 */

// Objects are elements with more robust styling requirements. They may include
// Components and utilities within them. Examples include headers, footers, modals,
// sliders, and charts. Not all Objects are required for each application and some
// will require their own Objects. Object namespaces are prefixed with 'o-'.
