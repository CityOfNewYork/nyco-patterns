A styled radio option group. Radio options are binary, only allowing one selection in a group of options. Color styling is determined by the [Color Combination utility](/colors) it is nested under. Note the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` used for making the radio group more understandable for all users. Read more about form grouping in [W3's Web Accessibility Tutorials](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/grouping/). The graphics for the radio input are included in the [icon sprite](icons#heading-icon-usage) that needs to be inlined in the DOM to appear.
