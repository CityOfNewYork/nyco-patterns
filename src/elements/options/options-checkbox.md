A styled checkbox option group. Radio options are additive, allowing multiple selections in a group of options. Color styling is determined by the [Color Combination utility](/colors) it is nested under. Note the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` used for making the checkbox group understandable for all users. Read more about form grouping in [W3's Web Accessibility Tutorials](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/grouping/). The graphics for the checkbox input are included in the [icon sprite](icons#heading-icon-usage) that needs to be inlined in the DOM to appear.
