{{ this.package.nice }} integrates the [Feather](https://feathericons.com) open source icon set for user interface icons. By default the dimensions for these icons are **{{ this.tokens.icons.icon-ui }}** (width and height).

It is recommended to install [Feather](https://github.com/feathericons/feather) icons independently in your project. The Feather package can be installed via NPM and contains a [JavaScript API](https://github.com/feathericons/feather#client-side-javascript), [Node.js API](https://github.com/feathericons/feather#node), and [SVG sprite](https://github.com/feathericons/feather#svg-sprite). You may also use the <a href="{{ this.package.cdn.url }}@v{{ this.package.version }}{{ this.package.cdn.feather }}">sprite in this repository</a>, but be sure to provide the appropriate attribution to the Feather project.

Other front-end framework implementations include:

* [React Component](https://github.com/feathericons/react-feather)
* [Vue.js Component](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/vue-feather)
* [Svelte](https://github.com/dylanblokhuis/svelte-feather-icons)

For prototyping svg files can be downloaded from [feathericons.com](https://feathericons.com) individually or from the project [Figma file](https://github.com/feathericons/feather#figma).
